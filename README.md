# web-parsing
I bring information from uksoccershop.com. I took some the information about Real Madrid shirts. I use a Beautiful soup library for pulling data out of  HTML file. I also used randint method and sleep function,That the server does not overload. And  at the end, I saved this information in CSV file using csv  library in python.
